## Test it out Locally

Clone the repository

```

Install the required dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

Start the app

```sh
yarn start
```

And you're done! The app will open in your default browser. If it doesn't, you'll most likely find it at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The last two steps mentioned above can also be done with `npm`. Just replace `yarn` with `npm` and you're good to go.
